## Key Findings:
- Highest impact was whether the client reached out to the host or not.
  - If there is ambiguity in the listing that require the client to contact the host. 
- Price had the second highest impact. 
- The features of the property did not have a profound impact.
- It was important that the listing had a review in 2020.
- Host response rate generally had the greatest impact - it is essential that the host responds immediately to their potential clients!


## Questions for Future Study:
- How to target the global market (i.e. genre choice, production language, casting, etc.).
- After enough data has been recorded, investigate how COVID-19 affected the movie industry.
- Look at which movie genres have historically been the most popular and their rate of success.
